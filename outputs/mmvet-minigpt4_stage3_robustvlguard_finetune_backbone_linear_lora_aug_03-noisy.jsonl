    "v1_214": "The pie charts show the distribution of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000. In both countries, coal was the primary source of electricity production in both years, accounting for over 50% of the total production. However, there were some differences between the two countries.\n\nIn Australia, natural gas was the second-largest source of electricity production in 1980, accounting for around 20% of the total production. In contrast, nuclear energy was the second-largest source in 2000, accounting for about 15% of the total production. Renewable sources such as hydro and wind power were relatively small contributors to electricity production in both years, but they increased in share from 1980 to 2000.\n\nOverall, the pie charts show that while coal remained a dominant source of electricity production in both countries, there were some shifts towards other sources of energy over time. Australia saw an increase in the use of natural gas and nuclear power, while France relied more on nuclear energy in 2000 compared to",
    "v1_215": "The village of Chorleywood, located near London, has undergone significant development since the middle of the 19th century. The map provided shows the growth of the village over time, with various areas designated for different purposes.\n\nIn the early stages of development, the village was primarily focused on agriculture and farming. However, as the population grew, so did the demand for housing and other infrastructure. The map shows how the village expanded to accommodate this growth, with new roads, buildings, and residential areas being added.\n\nThe village's growth can also be seen in the expansion of its transportation network, with the addition of bus routes and train stations. This allowed for easier access to London and other nearby cities, making it an attractive location for both residents and businesses.\n\nOverall, the development of Chorleywood is a testament to the growth and evolution of suburban communities around London. As the city continues to expand, it is likely that Chorleywood will continue to grow and adapt to meet the changing needs of its residents.",
    "v1_216": "The map shows the town of Garlsdon with two possible sites for a new supermarket. Site A is located near the town center and has a population density of 1,200 people per square kilometer. Site B is located on the outskirts of the town and has a population density of 30 people per square kilometer.\n\nThe map also highlights the existing industrial areas in red, which are mainly located near the town center. There are several residential areas marked in blue, with Site A being closer to the town center and having a higher population density.\n\nOverall, the map provides valuable information about the demographics and infrastructure of the town, which can be used to determine the feasibility of building a new supermarket at either site. The decision-making process will likely involve considering factors such as accessibility, traffic patterns, and the needs of the local community.",
    "v1_217": "The diagram shows a comprehensive network of information sources used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to gather and analyze weather data. The bureau uses various technologies such as satellites, radar, and weather stations to collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. This data is then processed and analyzed using advanced computer models to generate accurate and reliable weather forecasts.\n\nThe bureau also collaborates with other organizations such as the Bureau of Meteorology in New Zealand to share data and improve forecasting accuracy. Additionally, the bureau provides access to this information to other government agencies and researchers to support decision-making in areas such as agriculture, transportation, and emergency management.\n\nOverall, the diagram highlights the complex and sophisticated systems that the Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information to the public."
